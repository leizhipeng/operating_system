## Introduction

This project aims to showcase practical implementations of operating system concepts using the C++ programming language. The primary focus is on concurrent programming, memory management, and distributed systems. Each topic consists of example programs that demonstrate the core concepts.

## Concurrent Programming

The concurrent programming examples demonstrate the use of threads, synchronization, and inter-process communication. Topics covered include:

* Thread creation and management
* Mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables
* Producer-consumer problems and other classic synchronization problems

## Memory Management

The memory management examples focus on memory allocation, deallocation, and related techniques. Topics covered include:

* Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
* Memory allocation algorithms (e.g., First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit)
* Paging and segmentation

## Distributed Systems

The distributed systems examples showcase communication and coordination between distributed processes. Topics covered include:

* Client-server communication using sockets
* Consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft)
* Distributed file systems

## Building and Running

To build and run the example programs, follow these steps:

1. Install a C++ compiler and necessary development tools for your platform (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/leizhipeng/operating_system.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the example program directory that you want to build and run.
4. Follow the specific build and run instructions provided in the corresponding README file for each example.
